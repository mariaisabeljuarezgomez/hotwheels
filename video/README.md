# Hero Background Video Setup

## Video Requirements

To add a background video to the hero section, place your video files in this folder with the following names:

- `hero-background.mp4` - Main video file (MP4 format)
- `hero-background.webm` - WebM format for better browser compatibility (optional)

## Video Specifications

- **Format**: MP4 (H.264 codec recommended)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (Full HD) or higher
- **Aspect Ratio**: 16:9
- **Duration**: 10-30 seconds (will loop automatically)
- **File Size**: Keep under 50MB for optimal loading
- **Content**: Should work well with 50% opacity overlay

## Recommended Video Content

- Hot Wheels cars in motion
- Racing scenes
- Track animations
- Car collection showcases
- Abstract automotive themes

## How It Works

The video will:
- Play automatically on page load (muted)
- Loop continuously
- Stay fixed in the hero section with parallax scrolling
- Fade out as users scroll past the hero section
- Display at 50% opacity with text overlay

## Fallback

If no video is provided, the system will automatically show the original gradient background with animated track elements.
